<h2>Project Contributors</h2>

Bookworm was created by Benjamin Schmidt (Department of History, Northeastern), Matt Nicklay, Neva Cherniavsky Durand, Martin Camacho, and Erez Lieberman Aiden (Rice/Harvard Cultural Observatory). It enables visual and statistical exploration of massive collections of texts. If you use it in an academic publication, please include a link to bookworm.culturomics.org.

This web site and the D3 visualization libraries on top of the core bookworm infrastructure were created by Ben Schmidt.

Support for the project has come from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Digital Public Library of America, and the Open Science Data Cloud.
